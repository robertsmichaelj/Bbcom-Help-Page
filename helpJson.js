Customs policies vary widely from country to country and we recommend contacting your local customs office for further information. If you do get charged an additional fee, the carrier will expect payment at the time of delivery. If you refuse the shipment because of these charges, or if an order is rejected by customs due to item restrictions, or if the order is returned because the local post is unable to locate your address, we can refund you for the cost of the products (which does not include any shipping or return shipping fees) once the package is returned and processed by our warehouse. Please note that packages returned by customs can sometimes take a very long time to return, and in extreme circumstances can take as long as one year.</p>"

You can also view the tracking details of the order at the <a href='store/account/order-history'>Order History</a> section of your My Account page.</p><p>If your order's tracking does not update after 24 hours, please contact us for further assistance.<span> Also, keep in mind that while our warehouses are open seven days a week, our couriers only pick-up packages between Monday – Friday.</span></p><p>If your package's tracking shows any errors, please contact us as soon as possible so we can get them taken care of for you.

Nearly every international package we ship will pass through a major international sorting hub located in Frankfurt, Germany, before being forwarded to the destination country. This is not a cause for alarm if you see this information, your package will be leaving Germany very soon and the tracking will be updated again as it has reached your country's customs agency for clearance inspections.</p><h3>Timeframes</h3><p>Generally packages arrive in a very quick timeframe. In our experience, most packages reach customs within about 6-10 business days. Once your package has reached your government's customs agency, it must undergo clearance inspections. We do our best to speed-up this process by providing all of the required paperwork, but we are not able to determine exactly how long this will take for your order. Most of the time, packages are cleared within 5-7 business days and then handed-off to a local courier to complete delivery to you. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to speed this process.</p><p>Feel free to contact us if you feel your package is taking a unusually long time to reach you.

When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p><p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).</p><p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p><p>You have the right to request information about the personal data we hold on you. If your data is incorrect, incomplete, or irrelevant you can ask to have the information corrected or removed.

Bodybuilding.com is a trading name of Bodybuilding.com (UK) Ltd. We offer a wide range of products and services, and sometimes additional terms may apply. When you use a BBcom UK website feature (for example BodySpace, Gift Cards or BBcom UK applications for mobile devices), you will also be subject to the terms, guidelines and conditions applicable to that BBcom UK product or feature ('Service Terms'). If these Conditions of Sale are inconsistent with the Service Terms, those Service Terms will control.</p><p><b>Please read these conditions carefully before placing an order with Bodybuilding.com (UK) Ltd. By placing an order with Bodybuilding.com (UK) Ltd., you signify your agreement to be bound by these conditions.</b></p><h2>A. Our Contract</h2> <p>Your order is an offer to BBcom UK to buy the product(s) in your order. When you place an order to purchase a product from BBcom UK, we will send you an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the 'Order Confirmation E-mail'). The Order Confirmation E-mail is acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered. We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when we dispatch the product to you and send e-mail confirmation to you that we've dispatched the product to you (the 'Dispatch Confirmation E-mail'). If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive a separate Dispatch Confirmation E-mail for each package, and each Dispatch Confirmation E-mail and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between us for the product(s) specified in that Dispatch Confirmation E-mail. Your contract is with Bodybuilding.com (UK) Ltd. Without affecting your right of withdrawal set out in section 2 below, you can cancel your order for a product at no cost any time before we send the Dispatch Confirmation E-mail relating to that product.</p><h2>B. Returns</h2> <p>Please review the <a>Returns</a> section in the Help section of the Store page which applies to products sold by BBcom UK.</p><p>BBcom UK does not take title to returned items until the items arrive at the returns address destination.

Pricing and Availability</h2> <p>All prices are inclusive of legally applicable VAT.</p><p>We list availability information for products sold by us on the website including on each product information page. Beyond what we say on that page or otherwise on the website, we cannot be more specific about availability. As we process your order, we will inform you by e-mail as soon as possible if any products you order turn out to be unavailable, delayed or on back order if we cannot ship an item for some reason or you cancel the order, and you will not be charged for those products.</p><p>Please note that unless otherwise stated on the website, delivery estimates are just that. They are not guaranteed delivery times and should not be relied upon as such.</p><p>Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalogue may be mispriced. We will verify pricing when processing your order and before we take payment. If we have made a mistake and a product's correct price is higher than the price on the website, we may either contact you before shipping to request whether you want to buy the product at the correct price or cancel your order. If a product's correct price is lower than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount and send you the product. </p><h2>D. Product Information</h2> <p>Unless expressly indicated otherwise, BBcom UK is not the manufacturer of the products sold on this website. While we work to ensure that product information on our website is correct, actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information to that displayed on our website.

Your privacy is important to us and we would like our international customers to be aware that cross-border deliveries are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities.</p><h2>F. Our Liability</h2> <p>BBcom UK and its affiliates will not be responsible for (i) losses that were not caused by any breach on our part, or (ii) any business loss (including loss of profits, revenue, contracts, anticipated savings, data, goodwill or wasted expenditure), or (iii) any indirect or consequential losses that were not foreseeable to both you and us when the contract for the sale of products by us to you was formed.</p><p>The laws of some countries do not allow some or all of the limitations described above. If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above limitations may not apply to you and you might have additional rights.</p><p>Nothing in these conditions limits or excludes our responsibility for fraudulent representations made by us or for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct.</p><p>We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control.

If any of these Conditions of Sale is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p><h2>J. Waiver</h2> <p>If you breach these Conditions of Sale and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these Conditions of Sale.</p><h2>K.

Cookies enable us to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our sites and other sites. This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. For example, if we know what ads you are shown we can be careful not to show you the same ones repeatedly.</p><p>We do not associate your interaction with unaffiliated sites with your identity in providing you with interest-based ads.</p><p>We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display our interest-based ads. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalised ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who bought or browsed for whey protein). Also, some third-parties may provide us information about you (such as demographic information or sites where you have been shown ads) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.</p><p>Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the advertisements that appear on our sites directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalise advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by our <a href='#privacy'>Privacy Notice</a> or this Cookies &amp; Internet Advertising page. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. </p><p>Advertising Preferences</p><p>BBcom UK offers you choices about receiving interest-based ads from us.
