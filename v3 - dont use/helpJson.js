Orders shipped to countries outside of the United States may be subject to import taxes and customs duties levied by the destination country once a shipment enters the country. From our experience, most foreign customers are not charged when they receive the shipment, however, any additional charges for customs clearance must be paid by the recipient. Customs policies vary widely from country to country and we recommend contacting your local customs office for further information. If you do get charged an additional fee, the carrier will expect payment at the time of delivery. If you refuse the shipment because of these charges, or if an order is rejected by customs due to item restrictions, or if the order is returned because the local post is unable to locate your address, we can refund you for the cost of the products (which does not include any shipping or return shipping fees) once the package is returned and processed by our warehouse. Please note that packages returned by customs can sometimes take a very long time to return, and in extreme circumstances can take as long as one year.</p>"

You can also view the tracking details of the order at the <a href='store/account/order-history'>Order History</a> section of your My Account page.</p><p>If your order's tracking does not update after 24 hours, please contact us for further assistance.<span> Also, keep in mind that while our warehouses are open seven days a week, our couriers only pick-up packages between Monday – Friday.</span></p><p>If your package's tracking shows any errors, please contact us as soon as possible so we can get them taken care of for you.

As soon as the shipping label has been generated, you will receive an email with the tracking details. You can also view the tracking details of the order at the <a href='store/commerce/orderstatus.jsp?nl=true'>Order Status</a> section of out site.</p><p><span>Please note that it may take between 3-8 business days (Monday – Friday) for any initial tracking updates to appear.</span> This is because your order must pass through a major shipping hub before the online tracking system is updated. Nearly every international package we ship will pass through a major international sorting hub located in Frankfurt, Germany, before being forwarded to the destination country. This is not a cause for alarm if you see this information, your package will be leaving Germany very soon and the tracking will be updated again as it has reached your country's customs agency for clearance inspections.</p><h3>Timeframes</h3><p>Generally packages arrive in a very quick timeframe. In our experience, most packages reach customs within about 6-10 business days. Once your package has reached your government's customs agency, it must undergo clearance inspections. We do our best to speed-up this process by providing all of the required paperwork, but we are not able to determine exactly how long this will take for your order. Most of the time, packages are cleared within 5-7 business days and then handed-off to a local courier to complete delivery to you. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to speed this process.</p><p>Feel free to contact us if you feel your package is taking a unusually long time to reach you.

When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p><p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).</p><p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p><p>You have the right to request information about the personal data we hold on you. If your data is incorrect, incomplete, or irrelevant you can ask to have the information corrected or removed.

For example, we may use your e-mail address to confirm your request, to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.</p><p>However, we provide you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of communication from us, such as emails or updates from us regarding new services and products offered on the Sites. The opt-out choice may be exercised by ticking or unticking the appropriate box if such checkbox is available at the points where personal data is collected or by contacting us.

However, no e-commerce solution, website, mobile application, database, or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse.</p><p><span>E-mail Security:</span> “Phishing” is a scam designed to steal your personal information.
